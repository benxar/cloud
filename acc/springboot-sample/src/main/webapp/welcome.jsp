<div>
<p><span>Oracle Application Container Cloud</span> includes <span>Oracle Java SE Cloud Service</span>, which lets you deploy Java applications to the Oracle Cloud, and <span>Oracle Node Cloud Service</span>, which lets you deploy Node.js applications to the Oracle Cloud.</p>
<p>When you deploy your application you specify the kind of application, whether it's Node.js or Java. You don't have to choose when you subscribe; both are available when you deploy. Your application runs in a Docker container.</p>
